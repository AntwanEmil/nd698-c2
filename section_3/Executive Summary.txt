On the 22nd of sep 2020 a complete attack was performed on the server

1. The attacker with ip 192.168.56.1 tried to brute force SSH passwords.
2. Since SSH is not secured proberly (refer to section2/additional_remote_security_recommendations),
   the attacker succeeded in breaking into the system as user `ubuntu`.
3. After Gaining user access, he added a new user and group with the name `darklord`.
4. Then he installed a malicious code in the /tmp directory to open port `56565` to him in order to
   keep persistence on the server.


In order to  contain the threat the following steps were taken:

1. Adding the attacker's ip to the blacklist of iptables to reject connections in/out to this ip.
2. Shutting down the malicious process running at /tmp and deleting it.
2. Prohibiting remote login as root via SSH.
3. Performing OpenVas in-depth scan and mitigating all the mentioned vulnerabilites (Medium and High).
4. Patching Apache and de-privilge the apache account in order to prevent upcoming
   easy privilege escalation from attackers.
