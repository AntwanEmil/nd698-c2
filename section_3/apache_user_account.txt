# Provide the configuration lines you will update to ensure that Apache launches with group name as "apache-group" and user account as "apache-user".


#Configuration lines:


$groupadd -r apache-group
$useradd apache-user -r -g apache-group -d /var/www -s /sbin/nologin

in  /etc/apache2/envars edit the following lines:
    export APACHE_RUN_USER=apache-user
    export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=apache-group
then restart apache2 (sudo service apache2 restart)

** To make sure apache-user is running apache2 we can list all services running by this user (sudo lsof | grep apache-user) and notice apache2.
